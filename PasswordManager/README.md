This is a simple Python command-line password manager that uses Fernet encryption to securely store and retrieve passwords. It requires a master password to authenticate before allowing access to saved passwords. Users can add new passwords linked to account names or view existing ones, with all data encrypted locally for security. This project is a basic practice implementation of password management and encryption techniques.
